# Introduction

--

- The Trust for Public Land’s ParkScore Index: an annually released report which ranks the parks of the 100 most populated cities in the United States according to 4 key metrics: 

--
    - access
    - investment
    - amenities
    - acreage

--

- Covid-19 Pandemic emphasized need for public parks and the inequities that exist between cities

---

class: inverse, middle, center

# Question 1

---

### What is the relationship between spending per resident and park size in different U.S. regions and/or cities over time?

--

- Focus in cities that had spending data for each year from 2012 to 2020.

--

- Metrics of interest: spending per resident, median park size, U.S. Cities and their regions.

--

- Types of plots:
    - annotated scatter plot 
    - line chart over time

---

# Question 2

---
### How many amenities do parks with the top 10 and bottom 10 rankings in 2020 have and how does this vary based on what proportion of the top 10 and bottom 10 cities’ land is parkland in 2020?


--

- Focus in on Top 10 and Bottom 10 ranked cities in 2020

--

  - Top 10: Minneapolis, DC, St. Paul, Arlington, Cincinnati, Portland, Irvine, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago
  - Bottom 10: Memphis, Irving, Hialeah, Baton Rouge, Fresno, Lubbock, Forth Worth, Charlotte, Mesa, Oklahoma City

--

- Metrics of interest: percent of city that is parkland, geographic location, type of amenities and their numbers per residents

--

- Types of plots:
    - geographic map of the United States
    - stacked bar plot of amenities
