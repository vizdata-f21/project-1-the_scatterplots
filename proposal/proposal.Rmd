## Dataset

Our dataset comes from The Trust for Public Land’s ParkScore Index, an annually released report which ranks the parks of the 100 most populated cities in the United States according to 4 key metrics: access, investment, amenities, and acreage. There are `r nrow(parks)` rows and `r ncol(parks)` columns in the data set ranging from 2012 through 2020.

The COVID-19 Pandemic has laid bare a multitude of inequities that exist in the United States. While many people were able to flock to their local parks in order to get out of the house, many others were not. Our group is interested in exploring the Parks Access dataset in order to answer questions regarding access and equity to the nation’s largest cities’ parks. The Citylab article accompanying the dataset from TidyTuesday discussed a number of reasons for unequal access to quality parks and we are hoping to explore these in our project.

## Questions

1- What is the relationship between spending per resident and park size in different U.S. regions and/or cities over time?

2- How many amenities do parks with the top 10 and bottom 10 rankings in 2020 have and how does this vary based on proportion of the top 10 and bottom 10 cities’ land is parkland in 2020?

## Analysis plan

1- To answer the first question we are planning to use the `year`, `spend_per_resident_data`, and `med_park_size_data` from the dataset. We will create another variable of quartiles/quintiles of the spending per resident in order to create “bins” that each city-year can fall into as well as a categorical variable describing which region of the US the cities fall into. We plan on testing various visualizations that allow us to explore these categorical differences and then making the decision of which best suits our research question.


2- To answer the second question, we are planning to create a geographic plot of the 20 cities that rank within either the top 10 or bottom 10. We intend to use the variables `rank` and `park_pct_city_data`.  We will also use additional data to plot the points geographically on a map of the United States. We will initially attempt to do this through geocoding, using the ggmap package and guidance found at the following link. (https://www.jessesadler.com/post/geocoding-with-r/) In this map, we intend to display which proportions of each cities’ land is parkland through the size of the points on the map (using the variable `park_pct_city_data`).
